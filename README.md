# Lishuo Pan, Xuchen Wang - CIS 581 Project 3A

This project joins a group of three images together by detecting features from each images and matching them together. The result will be in a jpg image called 'ImageStitchingResult.jpg'.

# Running the tests

Go to main_script.py. Change the image paths in variable 'I0', 'I1', and 'I2' to the left, middle, and right pictures you would like to stitch.

Run main_script.py and check your folder for the resulting image, 'ImageStitchingResult.jpg'.
